- Is there treetop syntax highlighting for vim?
- strings
  - Specify string representation
  - Extend language to include strings
    - String literals in ol.treetop
    - StringLiteral in lang.rb
    - Convert string literals to "allocate; set;" sequence.
    - Open code concat()
- big picture
  - need to operationalize class and method definitions, & method lookup
    - this means allocating class/object structures, which means unifying
      alloc() calls
    - and it means specifying runtime representations of classes, methods, and
      applications
    - beginning approaches to these issues can probably be gotten from one of
      Appel's _Modern Compiler Implementation in Foo_ books.
